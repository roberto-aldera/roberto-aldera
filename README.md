### Hi there 👋
- 🤓 I’m currently based at [Thinkst Applied Research](https://thinkst.com/)
- 🤖 Previously at the University of Oxford for my DPhil (Oxford-speak for a PhD) in Engineering Science -> see publications [here](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=z3VqGqAAAAAJ&hl=en)
- 💬 Ask me about robotics, radar-based navigation, or food. Not necessarily in that order 🍝
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertoaldera/) is probably best ☺️
